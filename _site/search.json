    "text": "Part 1: Baltimore air quality data over time\nIn this section, I created visuals to show how levels of air pollutants have been falling in Baltimore across the last 40 years. This can likely be attributed to state- and federal-level interventions aiming to address the climate crisis. One example would be the Maryland Healthy Air Act of 2001 ((Maryland Department of the Environment, 2023)). Here, I used data from Baltimore. As the largest city in Maryland, one would expect changes to pollution regulations to have the largest effects here. In the subsequent parts of this analysis, I consider the effects that these changes (many of which are recent) can be expected to have on people’s health.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nclean_data &lt;- function(data, year) { #cleaning the data by dealing with the different labelling of NA values (\"NA\" for some categories and \".\" for others )\n  data %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n      year = {{year}},\n      across(\n        where(is.character), \n        ~ ifelse(. == \".\", NA, .) \n      ),\n      across(\n        matches(\"PM10.2nd.Max.24.hr|PM10.Mean.24.hr|PM2.5.98th.Percentile.24.hr|PM2.5.Weighted.Mean.24.hr|CO.2nd.Max.1.hr|CO.2nd.Max.8.hr|NO2.98th.Percentile.1.hr|NO2.Mean.1.hr|Ozone.2nd.Max.1.hr|Ozone.4th.Max.8.hr|SO2.99th.Percentile.1.hr|SO2.2nd.Max.24.hr|SO2.Mean.1.hr|Lead.Max.3.Mo.Avg\"),\n        ~ as.numeric(.)\n      )\n    )\n}\n\nb_data_1982 &lt;- clean_data(read_csv(\"/Users/rosiequint/Desktop/ScM Biostats/140.777 Stat Programming/Project1/conreport1982.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE), 1982)\nb_data_1987 &lt;- clean_data(read_csv(\"/Users/rosiequint/Desktop/ScM Biostats/140.777 Stat Programming/Project1/conreport1987.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE), 1987)\nb_data_1992 &lt;- clean_data(read_csv(\"/Users/rosiequint/Desktop/ScM Biostats/140.777 Stat Programming/Project1/conreport1992.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE), 1992)\nb_data_1997 &lt;- clean_data(read_csv(\"/Users/rosiequint/Desktop/ScM Biostats/140.777 Stat Programming/Project1/conreport1997.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE), 1997)\nb_data_2002 &lt;- clean_data(read_csv(\"/Users/rosiequint/Desktop/ScM Biostats/140.777 Stat Programming/Project1/conreport2002.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE), 2002)\nb_data_2007 &lt;- clean_data(read_csv(\"/Users/rosiequint/Desktop/ScM Biostats/140.777 Stat Programming/Project1/conreport2007.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE), 2007)\nb_data_2012 &lt;- clean_data(read_csv(\"/Users/rosiequint/Desktop/ScM Biostats/140.777 Stat Programming/Project1/conreport2012.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE), 2012)\nb_data_2017 &lt;- clean_data(read_csv(\"/Users/rosiequint/Desktop/ScM Biostats/140.777 Stat Programming/Project1/conreport2017.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE), 2017)\nb_data_2022 &lt;- clean_data(read_csv(\"/Users/rosiequint/Desktop/ScM Biostats/140.777 Stat Programming/Project1/conreport2022.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE), 2022)\n\n\n#Creating a single data frame for air quality by year\nbaltimore_air_quality &lt;- bind_rows(b_data_1982, b_data_1987, b_data_1992, b_data_1997, b_data_2002, b_data_2007, b_data_2012,  b_data_2017, b_data_2022) %&gt;%\n  select(-`Lead Max 3-Mo Avg`, -`CBSA Code`, -CBSA) #get rid because no data for any years\n\nprint(baltimore_air_quality)\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 14\n  `CO 2nd Max 1-hr` `CO 2nd Max 8-hr` `NO2 98th Percentile 1-hr` `NO2 Mean 1-hr`\n              &lt;dbl&gt;

I compared county-level data on mean PM2.5 concentration with the proportion living in poverty in each county.I chose to investigate PM2.5 specifically as it is believed to be the most harmful to human health, which was a central topic of my investigation ((World Health Organization, 2023)).

I included a regression line which shows a negative correlation (i.e. counties with higher levels of air pollutants having lower rates of poverty). This came as a surprise given the commonly-described association between poverty and poor health (for which air pollution is a known risk factor). However, this could be explained by area-level features such as wealthier counties tending to be more urban and thus have higher levels of pollutants, while poorer counties are more rural.

As would be expected, proportion in poverty and life expectancy have a strong inverse association. Furthermore, pollution appears to have no association with life expectancy. This echoes the previous finding that poverty and pollution did not have a clear association, and is also surprising as we would expect air pollution to have a negative impact on a person’s health. Again, controlling for a greater number of area-level factors may reveal a different story.\n\n\n\nggplot(combined_full_data, aes(x = `Proportions of Persons below 150% of Poverty`, y = `Life Expectancy`)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Poverty vs. Life Expectancy (Years)\", x = \"Proportion of Persons Below 150% Poverty\", y = \"Life Expectancy\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(combined_full_data, aes(x = `Micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5)(2)`, y = `Life Expectancy`)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", alpha = 0.5) + # Scatter plot with transparency\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"red\") + # Linear regression line\n  labs(\n    title = \"Relationship between Air Pollution and Life Expectancy\",\n    x = \"Air Pollution (PM2.5 in µg/m³)\",\n    y = \"Life Expectancy (Years)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + # Minimal theme for clarity\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), # Center the title\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10)\n  )\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel 1: Regressing life expectancy on air pollution and poverty measures\n\n\n\nHere I developed and tested three regression models for predicting life expectancy using air pollution and/or poverty data. Inspecting all of these models reinforces the trends shown by the scatter plots, with the best model appearing to be that which includes only poverty as a predictor for life expectancy. Adding air quality to this model (as in lm_full_model) as it increases the p-value and lowers the F-statistic. Therefore, all we can conclude from this data is that poverty rates in Maryland’s counties is a good predictor for their life expectancy (an already well-established relationship).\n\n\n\n\nlm_pollution_poverty &lt;- lm(`Proportions of Persons below 150% of Poverty` ~ `Micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5)(2)`, data = combined_full_data)\nsummary(lm_pollution_poverty)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = `Proportions of Persons below 150% of Poverty` ~ \n    `Micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5)(2)`, data = combined_full_data)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-8.692 -5.178 -1.875  5.485 15.151 \n\nCoefficients:\n                                        Estimate Std.
