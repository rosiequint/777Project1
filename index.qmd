# Welcome

Hi! I'm Rosie, and I am an master's student in biostatistics. I am interested in all kinds of problem solving, particularly in the fields of statistical genetics and genomics. I am from London and did my undergraduate in the UK, and in my spare time I enjoy playing the clarinet and hiking.
