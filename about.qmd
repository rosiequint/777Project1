# Bio

Hi everyone! I'm a current ScM biostatistics student at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. I am from the UK and graduated from Oxford University in 2024 with a BA in Human Sciences. I love exploring all different research possibilities within biostatistics and hope to get involved in statistical genomics and/or causal inference research.

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing the clarinet, most recently as part of the Hopkins Symphony Orchestra. I also love hiking, playing tennis and swimming.
